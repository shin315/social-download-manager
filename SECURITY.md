## Social Download Manager v2.0 Security Guidelines

### üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in Social Download Manager v2.0 to protect sensitive data and maintain a secure development environment.

### üõ°Ô∏è Protected Information

The following types of sensitive information are automatically excluded from version control:

#### Environment Variables & Secrets
- `.env` files containing API keys and credentials
- Configuration files with sensitive paths (`config.json`)
- SSL certificates and private keys (`.pem`, `.key`)
- Authentication tokens and secrets

#### Database & Data Files
- All database files (`.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`)
- Database backups and dumps
- Test databases and development data
- User-generated content databases

#### Logs & Debug Information
- Application logs (`.log` files)
- Debug output and error logs
- Performance monitoring reports
- Crash dumps and diagnostic files

#### Development & Test Artifacts
- Performance test results (`*_results.json`)
- Security scan reports
- Test output and temporary files
- Development configuration overrides

### üìã Security Checklist

Before contributing or deploying, ensure:

- [ ] No `.env` files are committed to version control
- [ ] `config.json` contains only non-sensitive template values
- [ ] No database files with real data are included
- [ ] Log files are excluded from commits
- [ ] API keys and credentials are stored in environment variables
- [ ] Test files with sensitive data are in `.gitignore`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Setup

#### 1. Environment Variables
Copy the template and configure your environment:
```bash
cp env.template .env
# Edit .env with your actual configuration values
```

#### 2. Configuration File
Copy the template and customize:
```bash
cp config.template.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your specific settings
```

#### 3. Required Environment Variables
At minimum, set these variables in your `.env` file:
```bash
APP_ENV=development
DEBUG=true
DATABASE_PATH=data/downloads.db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### üö® Security Incident Response

If sensitive information is accidentally committed:

1. **Immediately revoke** any exposed API keys or credentials
2. **Force remove** the sensitive data from git history:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch SENSITIVE_FILE' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```
3. **Update** `.gitignore` to prevent future incidents
4. **Generate new** API keys and credentials
5. **Notify** the team about the incident

### üîê Best Practices

#### For Developers
- Never commit `.env` files or `config.json` with real values
- Use the provided templates for configuration
- Regularly audit commits for accidentally included sensitive data
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Keep local development databases separate from production data

#### For API Keys & Credentials
- Store all credentials in environment variables
- Use different keys for development, staging, and production
- Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Use platform-specific credential management when available

#### For Database Security
- Keep development databases separate from production
- Use test data that doesn't contain real user information
- Regularly backup and encrypt production databases
- Implement proper access controls and authentication

### üìä Monitoring & Auditing

The project includes automated security measures:

- **`.gitignore`** prevents sensitive files from being tracked
- **Template files** provide safe configuration examples
- **Environment separation** ensures development/production isolation
- **Regular security audits** of dependencies and code

### üÜò Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** the security team directly (replace with actual contact)
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Wait** for confirmation before publicly disclosing

### üìù Compliance & Standards

This project follows:

- **OWASP** security guidelines for application development
- **Industry standard** practices for secret management
- **Git security** best practices for version control
- **Python security** guidelines for dependencies and code

### üîÑ Regular Security Updates

- Dependencies are regularly updated for security patches
- Security tools and scanners are used in CI/CD pipeline
- Code reviews include security considerations
- Regular penetration testing (if applicable)
