# Social Download Manager v2.0 - Enhanced UI/Functionality Testing & Migration Completion

## Project Overview
Complete the migration of Social Download Manager from v1.2.1 to v2.0 by systematically resolving translation system conflicts, fixing missing UI components, and thoroughly testing all functionality to achieve complete feature parity with enhanced stability.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Updated Issues Discovered**: Through UI comparison screenshots, multiple critical components are missing

### Translation System Issues (FIXED âœ…)
- **Legacy System**: `localization/language_manager.py` with `tr_()` method
- **Integration Gap**: BaseTab components using `tr_()` but not properly connected
- **Missing Keys**: Critical translation keys like `LABEL_SELECTED` not defined

### Critical UI Component Gaps (NEW DISCOVERY ðŸš¨)
**Video Info Tab - Missing Core Components:**
- **Missing Video Table**: No QTableWidget to display video info after "Get Info"
- **Missing Table Headers**: Should show Select, Video Title, Creator, Quality, Format, Duration, Size, Hashtags
- **Broken Info Display**: Video information not displayed in table format post-retrieval

**Downloaded Videos Tab - Incomplete Implementation:**
- **Missing Table Headers**: Table completely empty, no column headers visible
- **Missing Video Details Panel**: Bottom panel with thumbnail, metadata, and Play button absent
- **Broken Data Loading**: Videos not properly loaded/displayed from database
- **Missing Video Info Display**: No video details shown when selecting from table

### Database Integration Issues
- **Connection Problems**: DatabaseManager connection validation errors
- **Data Display Gap**: Database contains videos but UI doesn't show them
- **State Management**: Video data not properly synchronized between database and UI

## Key Requirements
