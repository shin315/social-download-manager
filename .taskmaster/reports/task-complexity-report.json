      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the architecture bridge task into subtasks for each adapter (MainWindow, VideoInfoTab, DownloadedVideosTab), event proxy system, data mappers, lifecycle management, error handling/logging, feature flag system, documentation, and coordination with related tasks.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves bridging two major architectural versions, requiring adapter patterns, event translation, data mapping, error handling, performance optimization, and coordination with other teams. The need for backward compatibility, comprehensive testing, and future removal planning adds to the complexity. The scope spans multiple components and cross-cutting concerns, making it a highly complex integration and refactoring effort[3][4][5]."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this migration into subtasks for initializing v2.0 components, integrating adapters, sequencing initialization, error handling/logging, graceful shutdown, configuration/documentation updates, backup/rollback mechanisms, and telemetry integration.",
      "reasoning": "While this task is critical, its complexity is moderate compared to the architecture bridge. It requires careful sequencing, integration of new and legacy systems, robust error handling, and rollback support. However, the scope is more contained, focusing on the entry point and startup/shutdown logic, with dependencies on already-developed adapters[3][4][5]."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the integration testing task into subtasks for test plan creation, baseline metric establishment, automated test execution, manual workflow validation, performance/load testing, regression/acceptance testing, cross-browser/device testing, issue documentation, and final reporting.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires a systematic, multi-phase approach covering all workflows, performance, regression, and acceptance criteria. It involves both automated and manual testing, metric analysis, and coordination with development teams to validate the integration. The breadth and depth of required validation, along with the need for comprehensive reporting, make it a complex QA effort[3][4][5]."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the migration preparation and testing into granular subtasks covering: detailed component-by-component test planning, adapter validation, migration script development, backup and restore procedures, state persistence verification, theme and i18n testing, import structure changes, rollback mechanism implementation, integration test orchestration, and final validation/reporting.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to its broad scope, deep technical requirements, and the need for robust validation across multiple architectural layers. It involves migration planning, component and integration testing, backup/restore, state management, theme/i18n, and rollbackâ€”all of which require careful coordination and detailed execution. The presence of multiple dependencies and the need for comprehensive automation and reporting further increase its complexity. Expanding to at least 10 subtasks ensures each critical area is addressed with sufficient granularity for effective management and risk mitigation."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: updating main window imports, updating module initialization and exports, updating testing components, scanning and updating all other imports, implementing backward compatibility layers, and updating documentation and migration guides.",
      "reasoning": "While this task is less complex than a full migration, it still requires careful handling of codebase-wide changes, backward compatibility, and documentation. The need to systematically update imports, maintain compatibility, and ensure no regressions through testing and documentation justifies a moderate-to-high complexity score and at least 6 subtasks."

      "reasoning": "Optimizing an adapter framework that bridges legacy and new architectures is inherently complex, involving performance profiling, event and state management, error handling, and memory optimization. Each area requires specialized attention and testing, warranting a high complexity score and at least 8 focused subtasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: creating archive directory structure, archiving legacy UI components, removing legacy files, updating .gitignore, cleaning up unused imports and references, removing adapter framework, and updating documentation.",
      "reasoning": "While the cleanup and archival process is more procedural, it still involves multiple steps that must be executed in the correct order to avoid data loss or regressions. Ensuring proper archival, codebase cleanup, and documentation updates justifies a moderate complexity score and at least 7 subtasks."

      "reasoning": "This task is extremely complex, involving the design and implementation of multiple advanced features across the UI architecture, each with its own technical challenges and integration requirements. The breadth and depth of enhancements, combined with the need for robust testing and documentation, necessitate a maximum complexity score and at least 10 detailed subtasks."
