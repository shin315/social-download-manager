# Social Download Manager v2.0 Refactoring Setup

## Project Overview
This document tracks the setup and progress of the Social Download Manager v2.0 refactoring project. The goal is to transform the current TikTok-focused application into a scalable multi-platform architecture.

## Repository Setup Status ✅

### Branch Management
- **Main branch**: `main` - Contains stable v1.2.1 code
- **Refactor branch**: `refactor/v2.0-architecture` - Current working branch for refactoring
- **Created**: `2025-01-XX` - v2.0 refactoring branch

### Backup Strategy
- Original v1.2.1 codebase preserved in main branch
- All refactoring work isolated in feature branch
- Can safely rollback to stable version if needed

### Task Management
- **Task Master AI**: Initialized and configured
- **Tasks created**: 25 main tasks + 35 subtasks = 60 actionable items
- **Current task**: Task 1 - Setup Project Repository ✅ IN PROGRESS

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Initialize git repository structure
2. 🔄 Create backup of current codebase  
3. ⏳ Setup new v2.0 directory structure
4. ⏳ Initialize documentation framework
5. ⏳ Setup development tools and configurations

## Architecture Vision
```
New v2.0 Structure:
social-download-manager/
├── core/                 # Core business logic
├── platforms/            # Platform-specific handlers  
├── data/                 # Data models and database
├── ui/                   # Refactored UI components
├── utils/                # Utility functions
├── localization/         # Language support
└── assets/               # Static resources
```

## Key Principles
- **Zero breaking changes** to existing TikTok functionality
- **Backward compatibility** maintained throughout refactor
- **Incremental refactoring** with working software at each step
- **Test-driven approach** with comprehensive testing
