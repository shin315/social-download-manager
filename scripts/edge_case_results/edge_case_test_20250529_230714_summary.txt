System Stability: MOSTLY_STABLE

OVERALL RESULTS:
Total Tests: 19
Passed: 18
Failed: 1
Critical Failures: 1
Recovery Tests: 2
Successful Recoveries: 2

PARTIAL_MIGRATION_FAILURE:
  ❌ database_corruption_simulation: Test setup failed: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'I:\\dev-work-space\\project\\app\\test-version\\social-download-manager\\scripts\\edge_case_results\\corrupted_test.db'
  ✅ disk_space_exhaustion: Simulated disk space check - system has sufficient space
  ✅ migration_interruption: Migration system handled interruption and restart successfully

NETWORK_INTERRUPTION:
  ✅ connection_timeout_simulation: Connection established within timeout period
  ✅ intermittent_connectivity: Intermittent connectivity simulation completed

INVALID_DATA_HANDLING:
  ✅ sql_injection_in_data: SQL injection attempts properly sanitized
  ✅ invalid_unicode_handling: Unicode handling working correctly
  ✅ oversized_field_values: Oversized field handled (length: 1048576)
  ✅ null_critical_fields: Null values properly rejected in required fields

VERSION_DETECTION_EDGE:
  ✅ corrupted_version_metadata: Version metadata corruption handling tested
  ✅ conflicting_version_indicators: Conflicting version resolution tested
  ✅ unknown_version_format: Unknown version format handling tested

LARGE_DATASET_STRESS:
  ✅ memory_pressure_test: Memory pressure handling tested
  ✅ long_running_migration: Long-running migration handling tested

CONCURRENT_USAGE:
  ✅ concurrent_database_access: Concurrent database access tested
  ✅ migration_during_usage: Migration during usage tested

ERROR_RECOVERY:
  ✅ automatic_rollback_test: Automatic rollback functionality tested
  ✅ manual_recovery_test: Manual recovery procedures tested

RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION:
  ✅ cpu_resource_limits: CPU resource limit handling tested

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. URGENT: Address critical edge case failures before production
2. - Fix database_corruption_simulation: Test setup failed: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'I:\\dev-work-space\\project\\app\\test-version\\social-download-manager\\scripts\\edge_case_results\\corrupted_test.db'
