    # Verify service is running
    $serviceStatus = Get-Service "SocialDownloadManager"
    if ($serviceStatus.Status -eq "Running") {
        Write-Host "‚úÖ Service restored successfully" -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        Write-Host "‚ùå Service failed to start properly" -ForegroundColor Red
        throw "Service restoration failed"
    }
    
    # Test basic functionality

    "Configuration File" = Test-Path "$env:APPDATA\social-download-manager\config.json"
    "Database File" = Test-Path "$env:APPDATA\social-download-manager\database.db"
    "Network Connectivity" = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "google.com" -Port 80 -InformationLevel Quiet
}

foreach ($component in $healthCheck.GetEnumerator()) {
    $status = if ($component.Value) { "‚úÖ OK" } else { "‚ùå FAILED" }
    Write-Host "$($component.Key): $status"
}
```

**STEP 2: SELECTIVE COMPONENT RECOVERY**
```powershell
# Recover only failed components
if (-not $healthCheck["Application Process"]) {
    Write-Host "üîÑ Restarting application process..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Social Download Manager\social-download-manager.exe"
}

if ($healthCheck["Service Status"] -ne "Running") {
    Write-Host "üîÑ Restarting service..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Restart-Service "SocialDownloadManager" -Force
}

if (-not $healthCheck["Configuration File"]) {
    Write-Host "üîÑ Restoring configuration file..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    $backupConfig = "$env:APPDATA\social-download-manager\backup\config.json"
    if (Test-Path $backupConfig) {
        Copy-Item $backupConfig "$env:APPDATA\social-download-manager\config.json"
    }
}
```

**STEP 3: VALIDATION AND MONITORING**
```powershell
# Quick validation of recovered components
Start-Sleep -Seconds 10

# Re-run health check
Write-Host "üîç Re-validating component health..." -ForegroundColor Blue
# Repeat health check logic from Step 1

# Monitor for 15 minutes
for ($i = 1; $i -le 3; $i++) {
    Write-Host "üìä Monitoring cycle $i/3..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
    # Basic monitoring logic
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 300
}
```

## Data Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

```sql
-- Emergency Database Recovery Script
-- Execute only if database corruption is detected

-- Step 1: Backup corrupted database
.backup corrupted_db_backup.db

-- Step 2: Attempt repair
PRAGMA integrity_check;
REINDEX;
ANALYZE;

-- Step 3: If repair fails, restore from backup
-- (Execute this manually with confirmed backup file)
.restore emergency_backup.db

-- Step 4: Verify recovery
PRAGMA integrity_check;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM download_history;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_preferences;
```

### Configuration Recovery

```powershell
# Configuration File Recovery
$configPath = "$env:APPDATA\social-download-manager\config.json"
$backupConfigs = @(
    "$env:APPDATA\social-download-manager\backup\config.json",
    "C:\emergency_backup_latest\config.json",
    "$env:APPDATA\social-download-manager\config.template.json"
)

foreach ($backup in $backupConfigs) {
    if (Test-Path $backup) {
        try {
            # Validate JSON before restoring
            $testConfig = Get-Content $backup | ConvertFrom-Json
            Copy-Item $backup $configPath -Force
            Write-Host "‚úÖ Configuration restored from: $backup" -ForegroundColor Green
            break
        } catch {
            Write-Host "‚ö†Ô∏è  Invalid backup file: $backup" -ForegroundColor Yellow
