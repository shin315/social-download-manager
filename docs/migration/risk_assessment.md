        metrics = self.collect_system_metrics()
        if self.detect_instability(metrics):
            self.trigger_stability_response()
```

**Immediate Stabilization**:
1. **Performance Reset** (0-5 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Emergency performance reset
   ./emergency_reset.sh --performance-mode
   # Disables non-essential features
   # Clears all caches and temporary data
   # Resets to minimal configuration
   ```

2. **System Diagnostics** (5-15 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Comprehensive system analysis
   ./system_diagnostic.py --full-analysis
   # Analyzes memory usage patterns
   # Checks for resource leaks
   # Validates component interactions
   ```

3. **Controlled Recovery** (15-30 minutes):
   - Gradually re-enable features
   - Monitor stability after each change
   - Document which features cause instability

**Escalation Triggers**:
- System unusable for >30 minutes
- Multiple users reporting same issues
- Memory usage >1GB consistently
