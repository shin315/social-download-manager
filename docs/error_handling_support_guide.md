## Overview

This guide provides support teams with comprehensive information for handling, diagnosing, and resolving errors in the social-download-manager application. The error handling system automatically categorizes, logs, and attempts recovery for most errors, but support intervention may be required for complex cases.

### Support Team Responsibilities
- **First-Level Support**: Handle common user-reported issues using automated recovery
- **Second-Level Support**: Diagnose and resolve complex errors requiring manual intervention
- **System Monitoring**: Monitor error patterns and system health
- **Escalation Management**: Escalate critical issues to development teams
- **User Communication**: Provide clear, helpful feedback to users

### When to Intervene
- User reports recurring errors despite automatic recovery
- Critical system errors that bypass automatic recovery
- Pattern of errors indicating system issues
- Performance degradation related to error handling
- Security-related errors requiring immediate attention

User Says: "Video won't download"
Likely Issue: Network, storage, or platform API error
Investigation: Check download logs, network connectivity, disk space

User Says: "It's running slowly"
Likely Issue: Performance category errors or excessive error recovery
Investigation: Check error frequency, recovery attempts, system resources

User Says: "Nothing happens when I click"
Likely Issue: UI validation error or component handling failure
Investigation: Check UI logs, input validation, event handling
```

#### Error Message Translation

**Technical Error Messages → User-Friendly Explanations:**
