// v2.0 (NEW)
interface PlatformHandler {
  supports(url: string): boolean;
  analyze(url: string): Promise<VideoMetadata>;
  download(url: string, options: DownloadOptions): AsyncIterable<DownloadChunk>;
}
```

**Configuration Structure**
```json
// v1.x format is no longer supported
{
  "downloadPath": "/old/path",
  "quality": "high"
}

// v2.0 format
{
  "downloads": {
    "defaultPath": "/new/path",
    "preferredQuality": "1080p",
    "concurrentLimit": 3
  },
  "ui": {
    "theme": "auto",
    "notifications": true
  }
}
```

### File Structure Changes
